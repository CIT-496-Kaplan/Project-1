# COMP 496P PROJECT 1

### HEllO ADAM KAPLAN

This is my final semester as a CSUN undergraduate. I current work at CSUN ARCS as a 
software engineer. I have plenty of experience using GitHub so this project was pretty 
easy for me. I am always pretty terrible at making self introductions, so I am going to 
end it here.
